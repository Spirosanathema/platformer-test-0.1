Just install the official Git software for your platform: Git - Downloads

Your Eclipse project is just a folder structure on your hard drive. Locate it. Open a terminal in this location (the root folder of your project) and init a new Git repo:

    $ git init

Create a new repo on Github. Eventually import any SSH keys in Github (it’s found in your settings there).

Set up your local repo to track the remote repo by simply following the instructions on Github (I’ll put them also here):

    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git 
    $ git push -u origin master

That’s it.

Every time you want to push your local changes to your remote repo you do:

    $ git add <filenames>
    $ git commit -m 'commit message'
    $ git push origin master

As long as you don’t use any other branches (which I do not assume in this example) you just push to the master branch.

This will also provide you some insights in the functionality of Git which will be hidden when using a plugin or some visual clients.

Replace <username> with your Github username and <reponame> with your repository name on Github (but these values should be prefilled by Github there).

Remember to never put any sensitive and confidential data on remote repos (like personal keys, passwords, etc.)!

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
git init
Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
git commit -m "First commit" (or "initial commit")
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Copy remote repository URL fieldAt the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click
to copy the remote repository URL.
In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
